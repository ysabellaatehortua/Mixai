<b><p> Our Story:</p></b>
    <p>

Oftentimes people -- especially college students -- find themselves with all the ingredients to make fun drinks but no knowledge of all the recipes that they could make. As a fairly expensive commodity, there is little room to make and try tons of different cocktails in order to figure out what you like. It typically takes years of testing out different cocktails and types of alcohol before people can tell what they prefer. In order to limit the amount of wasted money, wasted time, and unpleasant drinking experiences occurring worldwide, we are developing Mix.AI, a program that gets input from the user and generates cocktail recipes that the user is likely to enjoy, or that can be created with what the user already has at home.

<br> <br> <b>

Algorithm: <br> </b>

	The algorithm will be the essence of our project. We will be creating a genetic algorithm to create new recipes based on existing ones and user preferences. This will be done by creating a large population of drinks and then testing each of them against our fitness function to select the best of the group before repeating the process. We will also use a slightly different version of our algorithm to create slightly varied drinks based on the available ingredients.

<br> <br> <b>
Fitness function: <br> </b>
	Our fitness function will be what narrows down our population of drinks to fit more with the users’ input. This function will involve creating a flavor profile for each generated cocktail based on the amounts of each ingredient and then will test that against the desired flavor profile. We will make a few test cases so that we can help design the fitness function

Implement Genetic Algorithm → </b><br>
	•	Create a large population of drinks (good and bad) <br>
	•	Create new chromosomes by crossover or mutation <br>
	•	Add these new chromosomes to the population <br>
	•	Evaluate fitness of all chromosomes in the population <br>
	•	Retain only those with the highest fitness <br>
	•	Repeat last 4 steps until desired fitness is reached <br>
